### Introduction
Airport delays are one of the most common problems people face upon travelling. These delays are usually associated with certain carriers or destinations. Thus the question is, are they really the cause of these delays or is it due to other reasons?

In 2013, data about 336,776 flights were collected to answer this question, the data collected were about flights departing from New York City across all of its airports: John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to destinations all over the United States and some of its territories (Puerto Rico, and the American Virgin Islands). The data was described by 19 attributes shown in Table 1.

Although 3 airports per city may seem large, larger than many of the worldâ€™s capitals, the city that never sleeps hosts only 3 out of 16 airports of the state of New York which itself is not the host of the largest number of airports per state as shown in Figure 1.
